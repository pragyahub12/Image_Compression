## Image Compression in Matlab using different clustering algorithms 
Image Compression Using Clustering Algorithms
This project explores image compression techniques using various clustering algorithms, including K-means, Mean-shift, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Each method offers unique approaches to compressing and reducing the dimensionality of images.

## Overview
K-means Clustering: A popular clustering algorithm used to segment images into distinct color clusters, reducing the number of colors and compressing the image.
Mean-shift Clustering: A non-parametric clustering technique that finds clusters based on the density of data points, useful for segmenting images with varying densities.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique that projects image data onto principal components, effectively compressing the image while preserving significant features.
